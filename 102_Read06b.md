What makes a computer a computer, and how does it work?
* Computers do 4 things with information: Input, Storage, Process, Results
* Input: Take in information
* Storage & Process: takes information, manipulates it with algorithms, and then stores it. Stored as data. This continues until it's ready to be output
* Output: output can be many things! texts, images, videos, etc.
* Computers work on 1s and 0s. Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that store all information on the computer. One wire can be 'on' or 'off'. This state is called a bit. It can be represented by Yes/no, true/false, etc. 
* In the binary system we only have 0 & 1 (in decimal system we have 0-9). All decimal numbers can be represented in binary. 
* Letters and Words can also be represented with binary! 
* Photos, Videos, Graphics can also be represented with binary! Each of these things is made up of pixels. Pixels can be represented with binary. 
* Sound is vibrations which can be represented via wave form. You guessed it...it can be represented with binary. 

**Circuits & Logic**
Inputs and outputs are a type of information which can be represented by 'on' or 'off' electrical signals on a wire, or 1s and 0s. Simple circuits take an electric signal and flip it. Complicated circuits take multiple signals and combine them, then give you a result. 

The smaller a circuit is, the faster it can output because electricity doesn't need to travel as far. 

**Hardware & Software**
Hardware = circuits, chips, plugs, etc.
Software = programs, code, apps, webpages, etc.
Hardware and Software communicate via the CPU. CPUs have various circuits for different jobs. Add command, store command, move command, multiple commands, etc. We use programming to run commands. Your computer converts the commands to binary. 
Operating system: master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer. OS is the main control. Operating system shares programs in the computers memory.
