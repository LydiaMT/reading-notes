# HTML Notes
This is a compliation of my reading notes from the book HTML & CSS

## Chapter 18: Process & Design
Design your website for your target audience i.e. individuals vs companies, income, age, etc

Determine **WHY** people visit your website? What are they *motivations* and *goals*. Also determine **WHAT** your visitors are trying to achieve i.e. key tasks and motivations. **WHAT** information do your visitors need such as are the visitors familiar with your brand or do you need to explain it?. You also want to think about how frequently people will visit your site i.e. once, twice, daily. This will help you determine how often you need to update your site. 

Now that you know who is coming, why they are coming, and how they are using your site, let's create a sight map. Organize your site map with the **cart sorting** method, and make sure to think about how your visitors will want things organized over how you want things organized. Common card sorting organization will start with HOME as the main catagory, then have sub categories like ABOUT, ARTICLES, VISIT, SHOP, CONTACT, etc.

WIREFRAMES: sketch of the key inforamtion that needs to go on each page of your website. These are simple outlines with no color, fonts, images, etc. Your designer will support with those elements. Be prepared to share wire frames with clients. 

Create your CONTENT. PRIORITZE what content is the most important and make it destinct with design elements that pop to create a visual hierarcy. ORGANIZE or group related content into blocks. 

VISUAL HIERARCHY: "refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. Since most users will skim your page, create hierarchys through SIZE, COLOR, and STYLE. Larger elements will grab attention. Foreground and background color can create attention. Style can make important elements stand out. Images also create strong visual contract to draw viewers in. Remember, most of this is subliminal to the viewer. Be intentional. 

GROUPING & SIMILARITY: Grouping items or making them similar will help your viewer relate items to each other. Things that create this include proximity, closure, continuance, white space, color, boarders. Stay consistent with your style. Headings can be very helpful. 

DESIGNING NAVIGATION: concise (try to limit to 8), clear (predictable), selective, context (colors in the text to indicage which page the viewer is on), interactive (link changes when mouse hovers over it), consistent (keep the navigation the same across all pages)

## Chapter 17: HTML5 Layout
* Old HTML layout: developers used div tags with id's to define the purpose of the div i.e. header, navigation, sidebar, etc. 
* New HTML layout: now, some div's are replaced with the id name; so rather than ```<div id=header>``` you will see ```<header>```. This new way of writing HTML tags helps the author describe the structure of the page. 
* header & footer: Header may contain site name and main navigation. Footer may contain copyright info. If you have multiple articles on your page you may want headers and footers for each article.
* nav: Navigation contains major navigational blocks for the site i.e. home, about, classes, contact, etc.
* article: acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone i.e. article, blog, comment forum, etc. If a page has mutiple articles you will create multiple article tags that are their own section. You can next article tags. 
* aside: When used in an article tag, aside should contain content related to the article. When used on its own, it acts as a container for content related to the entier page i.e. links to other sections of the site, search box, etc. 
* section:
* hgroup:
* figure and figcaption:
* div:
* linking around block-level elements:
* helping older browsers understand:
