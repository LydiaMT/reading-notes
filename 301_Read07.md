## API Keys

Request a personal API key from the following APIs. You should receive these in your email within a few hours, often within minutes. Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment. Note: do not post your API keys in the Canvas discussion or on GitHub. Save them in a secure place.

### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

Key takeaways:
* It's very hard to track patterns within teams and can vary widely from group to group, There are essentially two types of successful groups: 
  1. Groups made up of smart, successful people who mostly speak when they are an expert on the topic, very little small talk, highly efficient, time efficient
  1. Groups made up of A mix of executives and middle managers with few professional accomplishments, discussions jump around, socialize when the meeting is over
* One key pattern that was discovered is Psychological Safety. Psychological Safety is a key component of collaboration. Amy Edmondson defines this as: *a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up; shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.*
  * Strong groups are typically made up of intuitive folks, also known as possessing *average social sensitivity*
  * Group norms are important, so of the two previously defined groups, it's important to be a part of the group that has norms more similar to yours for the group to be successful. You are likely to feel more psychologically safe with a group that has similar norms to you. 
  * If you are in a position of leadership within a group, being vulnerable with your group is a good way to build a sense of psychological safety within the group to help others open up. 

### How I explained REST to my brother

HTTP: 
* This tells the browser what protocol to use. It's like a GPS system
* Sort of link GETting resources, but more specifically it's a general purpose protocol for applying verbs to nouns:
  * HTTP GET: Systems retrieving information from each other
  * HTTP POST: Systems need to add information to another system
  * HTTP PUT/PATCH: Systems replacing something in the other system
  * 
REST: 
* A web page is a representation of resources
* computers use API and Web Services to share information via a url. Originally all machines in the world didn't need to 'talk' to each other when the internet was first created, but that's different now. 
* Data models, like Ruby on Rails
* The introduction of rails enabled a huge boost in productivity.
