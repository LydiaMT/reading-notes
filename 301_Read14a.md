### Introduction to Database Normalization

* Process to organize a database into tables and columns
* The main idea is your tables are specific
* Reasons for Database Normalization:
  1. minimize duplicate data
  1. minimize or avoid data modification issues
  1. simplify queries
* Issues with duplicative information:
  1. It increases storage while decreasing performance
  1. becomes difficult to maintain when data changes happen
* Modification anomalies
  1. Insert Anomaly:
  1. Update Anomaly
  1. Deletion Anomaly
  1. Search/sort issues
* Database Normalization:
  1. First Normal Form: info is stored in a relational table. Each column contains atomic values. Groups of columns do not repeat
  1. Second Normal Form: Like first normal form, but all columns depend on a primary key
  1. Third Normal Form: Like second normal form, but all columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
