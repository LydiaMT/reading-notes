## Description
This a collection of my reading notes for CodeFellows. 

### About Me
I am passionate about the environment and sustainability. I practice and teach yoga. Animal Crossing New Horizons enthusiast! You can find more of my work on my [GitHub](https://github.com/LydiaMT)

### Growth Mindset
In my words, the following are 3 reminders on how to maintain a growth mindset:
1. Believe that intelligence isn't static. There's always room to grow and learn more. 
1. You are not genetically born with a finite amount of 'smartness'.
1. **Believe in yourself!** Even if you can't do something now, if you keep at it you will be able to do it *someday*.
