### Growth Mindset
In my words, the following are 3 reminders on how to maintain a growth mindset:
1. Believe that intelligence isn't static. There's always room to grow and learn more. 
1. You are not born with a finite amount of 'smartness'. You have the capacity to expand your brainpower! You are capable. 
1. **Believe in yourself!** Even if you can't do something now, if you keep at it you will likely be able to do it *someday*.
