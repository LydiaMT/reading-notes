## Read: Class 30 - Hooks API

### Review, Research, and Discussion

**1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?**

Because a react app comes in via one html tag, usually a div with an id of 'root', you only need one html file for your browser view. To make multiple 'pages' in react, you have a main page and you re-render other pages through bringing in or removing different components. 

**2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?**
Inside the `<BrowserRouter />`, outside a `<Route />`. BrowserRouter wraps the whole page, so you would have recurring components like headers and footers in here along with some sort of app or main component that holds your 'subpages'

**3. What does props.children contain?**

Whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.

**Term** | **Definition**
-----|-----
Composition | Composition is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming. It describes a class that references one or more objects of other classes in instance variables. [stackify](https://stackify.com/oop-concepts-composition/)
Children / Child Components | Child components are basically components within components. Parents can have multiple components, and children components can be parents to their children components. 
Hash Routing | using the anchor part of the URL to simulate different content. For example http://site.com/#/products/list leads to displaying a list of products [krasimirtsonev](https://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/deep-dive-into-client-side-routing-navigo-pushstate-hash)
Link Routing | It is a dynamic routing algorithm in which each router shares knowledge of its neighbors with every other router in the network. A router sends its information about its neighbors only to all the routers through flooding. Information sharing takes place only whenever there is a change.
