# Revisions in the Cloud
These are my reading notes from [the following article](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/)

> " Since its inception in 2005, Git has become one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world."

To use Git, you will first need to install it on your computer as a package, via another installer, or download and compile the source code. The download process in the terminal is slightly different for Mac, Windows, and Linux. If you want to install different Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools, [click here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)

Customize Git with your own name and email address:
* git config --global user.name "your name"
* git config --global user.email "your@email"
* You can confirm your settings by entering the commands once more without the "your name" or "your@email"

If you want more information on a specific command, use the following"
* git help *command*
* git *command* --help
* man git-*command*
