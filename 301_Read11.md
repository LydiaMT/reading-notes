EJS Youtube videos

Embedded JavaScript templates
* For this tutorial you need express, body-parser, cors, and ejs
* `path` is a cor module for node
* In the first video, the author is building the basics for a server and gets EJS all set up and going. Make an index.ejs file as well. 

Injecting Values into the views
* To inject EJS variables the syntax is <%= variable_name %>
* Your index.ejs file seems like an index.html file that you can build out with javascript embedded into it. You can pass it into image tags, href, etc. 

For Loops and Arrays
* This video is so great! It looks like EJS is sort of a combination of HTML and JS in the same file. 

If/Else Statements
* You do not need the = sign if you are just evaluating something. You only need the = sign if you are adding in a value.  It kind of reminds me of template literal, but you're doing it in your HTML.
