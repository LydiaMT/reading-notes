### Sending Form Data

The objective of this doc is to understand what happens to data in a form when you hit submit. 

Client > server architecture
* Client (Browser) sends a request to a server using the HTTP protocol
* Server answers request
* Forms are a convenient way to configure HTTP requests and send data from the client to the server
* Most important form attributes are `action` and `method`
  * Method attribute: most commonly `GET` and `POST`
    * `GET`: hey server, get this data! Never use this for sending passwords
    * `POST`: hey server, take a look at this data then send it back to me! Best for sending large amounts of data
* Server technologies: 
  * Django for Python
  * Express for Node.js
  * Laravel for PHP
  * Ruby On Rails for Ruby
* To send files, take these extra steps: 
  1. set method to `POST`
  1. set value of `enctype="multipart/form-data"`
  1. include `<input type="file">`
* Security is super important when sending data to a server. Always check and sanatize your data
* Limit the amount of incoming data. Only allow what is necessary
* Sandbox uploaded files
