## Shay Howe’s intro to RWD
Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.

Responsive web design is broken down into three main components: flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media

### Flexible Layouts
* Relative viewport length: vw, vh, vmin, and vmax.
* formula to help identify the proportions of a flexible layout: **target ÷ context = result**
* Flexible Grid example using previous formula

```HTML
<div class="container">
  <section>...</section>
  <aside>...</aside>
</div>
```

```CSS
section,
aside {
  margin: 1.858736059%; /*  10px ÷ 538px = .018587361 */
}
section {
  float: left;
  width: 63.197026%;    /* 340px ÷ 538px = .63197026 */   
}
aside {
  float: right;
  width: 29.3680297%;  /* 158px ÷ 538px = .293680297 */
}
```
### Media Queries
Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example. 

* Use the `@media` rule inside of an existing style sheet
  * Common media types include all, screen, print, tv, and braille.
* Logical Operators in Media Queries: `and, not, only`
  * and: allows an extra condition to be added, making sure that a browser or devices does both a, b, c, and so forth
  * not: negates the query, specifying any query but the one identified.
  * only: new operator and is not recognized by user agents using the HTML4 algorithm, thus hiding the styles from devices or browsers that don’t support media queries.
* Media Features in Media Queries:
  * Height & Width Media Features. Within responsive design the most commonly used features include min-width and max-width.
  * Orientation Media Feature: The landscape mode is triggered when the display is wider than taller, and the portrait mode is triggered when the display is taller than wider: `orientation, landscape, portrait`
  * Resolution Media Feature: specifies the resolution of the output device in pixel density

Mobile First#mobile-first. The operating belief behind mobile first design is that a user on a mobile device, commonly using a smaller viewport, shouldn’t have to load the styles for a desktop computer only to have them over written with mobile styles later.

Viewport 
* Height & Width: For the height property the keyword device-height value is accepted, and for the width property the keyword device-width is accepted. Ex:

```HTML
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
```

* Scale: To control how a website is scaled on a mobile device, and how users can continue to scale a website, use the minimum-scale, maximum-scale, initial-scale, and user-scalable properties. ex: 

```HTML
<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=2">
```

### Flexible Media
* One quick way to make media scalable is by using the max-width property with a value of 100%.
* Unfortunately the max-width property doesn’t work well for all instances of media, specifically around iframes and embedded media.
* To get embedded media to be fully responsive, the embedded element needs to be absolutely positioned within a parent element. The parent element needs to have a width of 100% so that it may scale based on the width of the viewport. The parent element also needs to have a height of 0 to trigger the hasLayout mechanism within Internet Explorer. ex:

```HTML
<figure>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Fqg43ozz7A"></iframe>
</figure>
```

```CSS 
figure {
  height: 0;
  padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 */
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
}
iframe {
  height: 100%;
  left: 0;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
}
```

## All About Floats
* Float is a CSS positioning property. 
* Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page, which is different from elements that use absolute positioning. 
* 4 float properties: `left, right, none, inherit`
* `clear`: An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float i.e. a footer that you want to be at the bottom of the page rather than to the right of your floated element. 
  *  `both, left right`
* Techniques for Clearing Floats: use pseudo selector (:after) to clear floats.

## Don’t Overthink It Grids
Note: reference this article when applying grid features to your CSS. It's very step-by-step and has great class naming recommendations. Essentially you define your parent div as a grid and the children and columns. Then, float them to the left and set their widths as %. You also need to consider your grid gutters.

## CSS Floats Explained By Riding An Escalator
Analogy article to explain floats using an escalator. Key takeaways: 
  * Floats create alternate flows
  * Using floats can introduce up to two new flows: left and right
  * Clear property: “Clear” allows elements to specify where they should align in comparison to the floated elements. One of the most frequent uses of the clear property is “clear:both”. This allows you to reset the flow of elements, as opposed to continuing to maintain a right, left and normal flow.
