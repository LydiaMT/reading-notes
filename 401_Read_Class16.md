### Review, Research, and Discussion

**1. Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle**

The Web Request Response Cycle is the cycle between a client and a server. Clients send requests to the server, and the server sends requests back to the client. If there is a database involved, the server will sometimes become the client and send requests to the database, which then sends the response back to the server, and the server sends the response back to the client. 

**2. Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC**

A server is the thing that sends a response back to the client

**3. What does it mean to “deploy” an application?**

Deploying an application means you have pushed it up to a hosting site that can host your application. 

**Term** | **Definition**
-----|-----
Server | Something sending a web response
Pub/Sub | In software architecture, publish–subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead categorize published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be.
