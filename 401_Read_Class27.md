## Read: Class 27 - Props and State

### Review, Research, and Discussion

**1. Does a deployed React application require a server?**

It is not necessary

**2. Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?**

Because there is so much variability with the front end, and because the front end changes so frequently your tests may start failing from small updates. 

**3. What does `npm run build` do?**

Creates a build directory with a production build of your app

**4. Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application**

React apps are made up of components. You typically have a top level component that brings components together to be displayed on a webpage. Components will have children components. 

**Term** | **Definition**
-----|-----
BDD | Behaviour Driven Development is an agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA, and non-technical or business participants in a software project. It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)
Acceptance Test | A level of software testing where a system is tested for acceptability. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the system’s compliance with the business requirements and assess whether it is acceptable for delivery [Software Testing](https://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/acceptance-testing)
mounting | Mounting is a process by which the operating system makes files and directories on a storage device (such as hard drive, CD-ROM, or network share) available for users to access via the computer's file system [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_(computing))
build |  In a programming context, a build is a version of a program. As a rule, a build is a pre-release version and as such is identified by a build number, rather than by a release number. [TechTarget Contributor](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/build)
