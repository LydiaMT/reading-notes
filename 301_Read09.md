### Functional Programming Concepts

*What is functional programming?*
>Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia

**Enter Pure Functions**: Pure functions are deterministic. They will return the same results if given the same argument. They do not cause any observable side effects. Pure functions do not use external objects. They cannot read external files as the external files content could change. They cannot include a random generator. One benefit of Pure Functions is the code is easier to test.

**Immutability**
>Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

You do not change immutable objects, you instead create new objects with new values.
* Use Recursion for iterations to keep variables immutable

*Referential Transparency*
>pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

*Functions as first-class entities*
Try to write functions as values. That way you can combine your functions to make more complex functions. Functions within functions!

*Enter: Higher-order functions*
Now that we're using first-class entities, we can write Higher-order functions. These take one or more function as arguments and return a function as the result.
* filter: "The filter function expects a true or false value to determine if the element should or should not be included in the result collection."
* map: "The map method transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values."
* reduce: "Receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items"

### Refactoring Javascript for Readability

Refactoring is a bit more of an art than a science because there is always an edge case! You want a combination of speed as well as developer comprehension. 

Some best practices directly from this article: 
* Return early from functions
* Cache variables so functions can be read like sentences
* Check for Web APIs before implementing your own functionality:

Also, refactor your first time! Many businesses do not care about refactoring, so save yourself the work upfront.
