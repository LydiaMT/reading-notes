## Read: Class 28 - Component Composition

### Review, Research, and Discussion

**1. Can a parent component access the state of a child component?**

Yes. One way to do this is via a callback function like onClick which can alter the state of the childen component from the parent component level.

**2. What can be passed along in a prop variable?**

Default values and custom HTML attributes.

**3. How can a child component “know” the state of another component?**

Via a callback function.
