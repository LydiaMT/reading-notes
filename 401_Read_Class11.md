## Read: Class 11 - Event Driven Applications

### Review, Research, and Discussion

**1. Why is access control important?**

Access control is important to prevent other users from making edits to content that you created, for example. If access control did not exist, anyone could edit or delete other people's content on the internet. 

**2. Describe an application that would need access control.**

A social media application like Instagram. You would want users to only be able to create, update, and delete their own content, and then read other users content.

**3. What is a role used for?**

A role is used to define what kind of access that user has. For example, an administrative role probably has more access and authorization than a standard user role. 

**4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?**

Because it's easy to change a users role rather than having to change the whole system. In Discretionary and Mandatory access control systems you have to edit the software or the operation system in order to grant more access, whereas with a role based system you can simply change a users role which instantly grants them or denies them certain privileges. 

**Term** | **Definition**
-----|-----
Authorization | The function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization)
Role Based Access Control | Access control mechanism defined around roles and privileges, like admin, user, writer, editor. Different user types are granted or denied certain types of actions, like create, read, update, and delete [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)
Capabilities | token of authorization [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security)
