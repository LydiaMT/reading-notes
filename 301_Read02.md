## Chap 7 jQuery pages 293-301, pages 306-331, & pages 354-357
* JQuery is similar to the DOM method but simpler
* Uses CSS selector syntax to target or create elements on your HTML page
* for JQuery you will link the location of your .js file along with a jquery library at the bottom of the body tag. JQuery Library First, .js file that references that library second. 
  * You don't need to necessarily understand what's happening under the hood with jQuery to utilize it!
* jQuery is great to use because selecting elements is simple and most common tasks end up using less code. 
* Multiple elements: jQuery will assign references for each node if there are multiple elements. These are assigned like an index number and start at 0. 
* Looping: in jQuery use the .each() method rather than writing a loop. This way you can select and manipulate multiple elements at once. 
* Chaining: this is a process where you chain multiple methods together with dot notation
* Ways to load jQuery: .load(), .on(), .ready()
* Getting element content: 
  * .html(): returns text content and the HTML content.
  * .text(): returns the text content. 
* Updating elements: .html(), .text(), .replaceWith(), .remove()
* Changing content: be mindful of when you use single vs double quotes. 
* Inserting elements: To insert an element you have to (1)create the new element and (2) insert the content to the page with a method. 
  * To insert elements use one of the following methods depending on the use case: .before(), .after(), prepend(), append()
* Getting & Setting attribute values: 
  * .attr(): gets or sets specific value
  * .removeAttr(): removes specific attribute
  * .addClass(): adds new value to existing class
  * .removeClass(): removes value from the class attribute
* .css() : you can use this method to add css properties to elements on your page 
* .each() : This is like a loop in jQuery. It runs an anonymous function and uses the keyword 'this' or '$(this)' to reference the current element node in the loop. 
* .on() : handels events. It takes two parameters. First parameter = event you want to respond to. Second parameter = code you want to run when that event occurs on elements in the matched set. 

Common jQuery events

TYPE | EVENT
-----|-----
UI | focus, blur, change
Keyboard | input, keydown, keyup, keypress
Mouse | click, dbclick, mouseup, mousedown, mouseover, mousemove, mouseout, hover
Form | submit, select, change
Document | ready, load, unload
Browser | error, resize, scroll

Additional Parameters for Event Handlers

```js 
.on(events[, selector][, data], function(e));
```

* When you have jQuery on your page, try to load it from a CDN. If that doesn't work you can include a current version store on your own server
* Script placement for optimized loading: 
  * In the head: avoid
  * In the page: avoid
  * Before the closing body tag: best spot!
